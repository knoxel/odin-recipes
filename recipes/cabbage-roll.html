    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An unstuffed cabbage roll is basically a deconstructed version of a regular casserole. All the traditional cabbage roll ingredients (cabbage, ground beef, tomatoes, other veggies, and spices and seasonings) are cooked together â€” so you don't have to worry about pre-cooking and rolling the cabbage. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground chicken</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Canned Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Rice (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Heat a Dutch oven or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot Dutch oven until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Add cabbage, tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, garlic, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat, and simmer until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes. </li>
